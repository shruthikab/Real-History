## Causes of the First World War
### Assasination of Prince Ferdinand
> 6) Tensions between the United States and Mexico reached a peak in the middle of the 19th century when a string of contentious incidents lit the fuse that would eventually result in the start of the Mexican-American War in 1846. Long-standing disagreements over the Texas–Mexico border, made worse by episodes like the Thornton Affair, which brought both countries dangerously close to war, were at the center of these tensions.
The Thornton Affair, a conflict that took place on April 25, 1846, along the disputed border between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, was one of the major events that increased tensions. Mexican forces and American troops under Captain Seth Thornton's command engaged in combat. There was disagreement over the precise border's location: Mexico insisted that the Nueces River should serve as the official border, while the United States insisted that the Rio Grande should serve as the border. The Thornton Affair, a short-lived but fierce fight that claimed several American troops' lives and led to their capture, exacerbated already sour ties between the two countries.
The border between Texas and Mexico was a powder keg waiting to be lit. Texas' annexation by the United States in 1845 had been a divisive decision because Mexico fiercely resisted the inclusion of the region, which it still saw as belonging to its own sovereign area. 
The annexation and the different interpretations of the border created the conditions for a conflict that went beyond simple territorial disagreements. As neither country was prepared to give up, it turned into a conflict of beliefs and pride in their countries.
Since neither side was prepared to give in, diplomatic attempts to defuse the growing tensions failed. Both sides' rhetoric heated up, propelled by American Manifest Destiny zeal and Mexican resistance to what they saw as American invasion. Compromise was challenging because the Mexican government, which was already dealing with internal unrest, saw the conflict as an issue of national dignity and integrity.
President James K. Polk, a fervent supporter of westward migration, asked Congress to declare war on Mexico, which was the turning point. Polk asserted—a claim that was contested by some who questioned the exact position of the border—that Mexican forces had invaded American territory and had killed Americans on American land. Still, Congress accepted the declaration of war in May 1846, and hostilities started.
A perfect storm of historical grudges, geographical disputes, and nationalistic zeal culminated in the circumstances leading up to the start of the war in 1846. The Texas-Mexico border dispute and the Thornton Affair came to symbolize larger tensions that had been building for years and finally forced both countries into a full-fledged battle. 
The complicated beginnings of the Mexican-American War would have a significant and enduring impact on North America's environment and politics.
