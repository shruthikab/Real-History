## How did Manifest Destiny Influence Americans?


> The powerful idea of "Manifest Destiny," which first surfaced in the early 19th century, played a major role in determining the course of American expansionism. Fundamentally, the idea of "Manifest Destiny" represented the belief that the United States' expansion of influence and territory throughout the continent of North America was predetermined by a higher authority. This ideology fostered an entitlement and exceptionalist mentality among Americans in addition to offering a moral defense for westward migration.
Although the idea of Manifest Destiny dates back to the early republican days, it really took off in the 1840s when it began to resonate with the idea of American exceptionalism. Manifest Destiny proponents thought that America was a shining example of liberty and progress, embodying democratic values. They saw the westward movement as a noble endeavor, a dissemination of the American way of life meant to tame the untamed west and bring civilization to the border.
The American pioneers were drawn to large, uncharted areas with undeveloped resources, and Manifest Destiny gave them a moral reason to migrate west. The philosophy gave the drive for territorial expansion a sense of justice in addition to justifying it.
In the context of contentious areas like the Southwest and Texas: Texas, which was once a part of Mexico, became the center of American expansionist ambitions. Promises of rich land and financial opportunities drew Anglo-American settlers, who started to establish themselves in the area. Tensions with Mexico increased after the United States annexed Texas in 1845.
The Southwest, which includes modern-day California, New Mexico, Arizona, and other states, was likewise a hub for goals motivated by Manifest Destiny. The US wanted to control these regions for strategic reasons as well as the allure of gold in California and abundant agricultural land.
Conflicts with Mexico were unavoidable as the US pressed its claims to these disputed areas. The attitude of entitlement ingrained in Manifest Destiny intensified hostilities between Mexicans and Americans over divergent ideas of who should control territory.
The events leading up to the Mexican-American War were powerfully framed by the ideological fervor of Manifest Destiny, as both countries fought for supremacy in the disputed swaths of the Southwest.
In conclusion, Manifest Destiny was a strong factor that influenced American expansionism and helped to legitimize westward migration by encouraging a sense of entitlement and moral superiority. This philosophy was crucial in pushing the US to make its claims in the disputed areas of Texas and the Southwest and in laying the groundwork for wars that would eventually change the continent's geographic boundaries.
