## Increase of Tensions

> What was the point where the Mexican-American tensions reached its peak?

In the mid-19th century witnessed the culmination of tensions between the United States and Mexico, as a series of controversial events ignited the spark that would lead to the outbreak of the Mexican-American War in 1846. At the heart of these hostilities were long-standing disputes over the Texas-Mexico border, exacerbated by incidents like the Thornton Affair, which collectively pushed both nations to the brink of armed conflict.
One of the critical incidents that heightened tensions was the Thornton Affair, a clash that occurred on April 25, 1846, along the disputed border between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. American troops, led by Captain Seth Thornton, found themselves in a confrontation with Mexican forces. 


The exact location of the border was a matter of contention, with the United States insisting on the Rio Grande as the boundary, while Mexico maintained that the Nueces River was the rightful demarcation line. The Thornton Affair, marked by a brief but intense skirmish, resulted in the death and capture of several American soldiers, further inflaming the already strained relations between the two nations.

The disputed Texas-Mexico border was a powder keg awaiting ignition. The annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845 had been a contentious move, as Mexico vehemently opposed the incorporation of the territory it still considered part of its own sovereign land. The annexation, coupled with the divergent interpretations of the border, set the stage for a confrontation that extended beyond mere territorial disputes. It became a clash of ideologies and national pride, with both nations unwilling to back down.
Diplomatic efforts to resolve the escalating tensions faltered, as neither side was willing to make concessions. The rhetoric on both sides intensified, fueled by the fervor of Manifest Destiny in the United States and Mexican resistance to what they perceived as American aggression. The Mexican government, already grappling with internal instability, viewed the dispute as a matter of national honor and integrity, making compromise difficult.

The tipping point came when President James K. Polk, a strong advocate of westward expansion, sought a congressional declaration of war against Mexico. Polk argued that Mexican forces had crossed into U.S. territory, shedding American blood on American soilâ€”an assertion disputed by those who questioned the precise location of the border. War (Knight 510). Nevertheless, in May 1846, Congress approved the declaration of war, and hostilities officially commenced.

The U.S. used a 3-part strategy to battle Mexico with an Army of the West who stayed in New Mexico, Amry of the Center who stayed in northern Mexico, and the army of Occupation who attempted to take over Mexico City led by General Winfield Scott (Locks 1).
